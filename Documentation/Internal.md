A Note to Seasoned Developers
-
Roblox's moderation has failed developers in so many ways. Assets on the creator store are consistently
taken down for illogical and unfounded reasons. It's now impossible to publicly distribute a module that
can be dynamically updated through a simple require(ID), unless you're one of the few lucky creators whose
asset was selected as "pre-approved" before Roblox dropped the update back in 2022 that destroyed all systems
that rely on being able to update code remotely, versus forcing developers to manually update the software
each time that an update was published. As a result of this, ReSync is loaded into your game using
unconventional means. Roblox actively stops any and all attempts to use require(ID) or
InsertService:LoadAsset(ID) in public modules by pulling them off the creator marketplace entirely. While this
is admittedly very inconvenient, there's one final, albeit performance-intensive workaround that can be applied
to bypass this structure entirely, not relying on any built-in Roblox methods other than those detailed in
HttpService.
